# AI-Powered GitHub Issues to Notion Workflow

An intelligent n8n automation that transforms GitHub issue management by automatically syncing issues to Notion with AI-powered summarization and enrichment.

![n8n Workflow Diagram](image.png)

## 🌟 Overview

This workflow creates a seamless bridge between **GitHub** and **Notion**, leveraging **Google Gemini AI** to automatically process, summarize, and organize GitHub issues into a structured Notion database. Perfect for teams who want to centralize their issue tracking and project management.

## 🔧 How It Works

The workflow consists of 4 main components:

1. **🔗 GitHub Trigger**: Monitors your repository for new or updated issues
2. **🤖 AI Agent**: Uses Google Gemini to intelligently summarize and structure issue data
3. **📋 Structured Output Parser**: Formats the AI response into consistent JSON structure
4. **📊 Notion Database**: Creates organized pages with enriched issue information

### Workflow Process:

1. **Issue Detection** → GitHub webhook triggers when issues are created/updated
2. **AI Processing** → Gemini AI analyzes the issue and creates:
   - Concise summary
   - Actionable items
   - Additional context notes
3. **Data Structuring** → Output is formatted with repository metadata
4. **Notion Creation** → Structured data becomes a new Notion database page

## 📊 Notion Database Structure

The workflow creates Notion pages with the following properties:

| Column Name          | Type     | Description                    |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| **Title**           | Title    | Issue title from GitHub       |
| **Summary**         | Text     | AI-generated concise summary  |
| **Action Items**    | Text     | Key tasks and next steps      |
| **Notes**           | Text     | Additional context            |
| **Repository**      | Text     | Repository name               |
| **Repository URL**  | URL      | Direct link to repository     |
| **Status**          | Select   | Issue state (open/closed)     |
| **Last Activity**   | Date     | Last update timestamp         |
| **Assigned To**     | Text     | GitHub assignee information   |
